# Playing paddle ball game using Deep Q-Learning algorithm
This project demonstrates training a machine to play simple paddle ball game using Deep-Q Learning algorithm with Keras.

This article is intended for beginers.

## Pre-requisites
* Python (tested on 3.6)
* Keras
* Theano/Tensorflow
* pygame

## Run the code

First train the model

`python train-paddle-ball.py`

Then test the model

`python test-paddle-ball.py`
